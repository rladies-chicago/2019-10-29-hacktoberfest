# Hacktoberfest with R-Ladies Chicago  
  
### About :jack_o_lantern:  

This repo is for R-Ladies Chicago's October Meetup, our [Hacktoberfest Hack or Treat](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-chicago/events/265379879/)! We'll open some issues in this repo and others within our [organization](https://github.com/rladies-chicago). Complexity will range from *very* beginner-friendly to intermediate. We'll then work together to make some pull requests (PRs). We're open to any contributions: from fixing a typo on our website to adding a tutorial to our R-beginners repo!

### How it Works  
  
Hacktoberfest is an opportunity to contribute to others' projects on GitHub. People will indicate a specific repo needs contributions by opening [issues](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-issues). To make this contribution, you would make [your changes](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-branches) to an existing repo and then make a [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests) to let the repo owner that you have implemented a change.    
  
### Open Issues  
  
We'll be opening some issues to work on soon! You'll be able to find them by clicking on the "Issues" tab at the top of a given repo. We'll include some links to these issues here within reason.  
  
If you have a project on GitHub that could use some extra eyes/hands, please let us know and label it with `rladies-chicago`. We can also link the issue here!  
  
You can search GitHub for [issues](https://github.com/search?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Ahacktoberfest&state=open&type=Issues) that have been tagged as a good way to contribute to Hacktoberfest.
